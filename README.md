# Drug_Response_Prediction
Computational drug response prediction using transcriptomic data

2021-11-17.  
Migrating project to drg_rsp_main repo.  
  Three corresponding sub-repos organized by operational objective.  

2021-10-29
Reproduce drug response querry for CTRP.  
Apply to PRISM and CCLE-NP.  

Preprocess expression and response data for Keras pipeline.  

2021-10-18
Reproduce generation of CTRPv2_16_beta_bromoandrosterone.tsv
  (in data directory)
  
Requires mapping of cell lines to drug response object.  
Timing of querries added for reviewing workflow
