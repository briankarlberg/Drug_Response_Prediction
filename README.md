# Drug_Response_Prediction
Computational drug response prediction using transcriptomic data

Goal:
Run both continuous and binned response predictions.  
Computational, pathway informed, and random feature selection
Benchmark conventional ML vs. Keras

Questions:
Cancer-type specific?

Next-actions:  
  Check-in drg_rsp_v2.ipynb.     
  Build and check CCLE drug resp (querry).   
  Build and check-in CCLE gene expression by cell code.   
CCLE object appears to be from expression chunks. 
  exp_chnks nb:_________.  
  
  Build and check drug_response_CTRPv2.   
  drg_rsp ctrp nb:________.  
  
Need to do subsetting of files on exacloud

Reproduce generation of CTRPv2_16_beta_bromoandrosterone.tsv
  (in data directory)
  
Requires mapping of cell lines to drug response object
Timing of querries
